  dialogue:
  - All these mutated fucks out here, can't have a single moment of peace and quiet...
  - Oi who are you then? You here to test some dialogue?
  - First these mutated monkeys screaming my ears off and now you!
  - Oh lord just end me now, why don't ye?
  - At least you don't talk too much, I guess, unlike that freak Arnold.
  - Now then, time to scurry along ye cunt, get off me lawn!

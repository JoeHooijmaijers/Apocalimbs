  dialogue:
  - Oi, you! You look like you're keeping it together, unlike that scared boy and
    the rest of the mutts around here.
  - Could you do me a solid? I mean, if it's not too much to ask.
  - You see, theres this big fellow past the park and streets. He didn't seem to like
    me much.
  - The guy started slamming his fists on the ground, and would you believe it, the
    ground under my feet just erupted!
  - If I weren't such a fast guy I'd have definitely been toast!
  - Aaanyway, I want him gone, killed. Not like he's sane anyway...
  - Cheers friend, I'll see you around!
